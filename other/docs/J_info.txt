✔️ How Jenkins fits in

Your Jenkins Jenkinsfile from earlier stays mostly the same:

Builds Docker image

Pushes to ECR

Runs terraform apply to update EC2

The EC2 instance pulls the new image via user-data or SSM








If you want zero-downtime rolling updates, I can generate:

An Auto Scaling Group + Launch Template

ALB (Application Load Balancer)

Rolling deployment strategy
